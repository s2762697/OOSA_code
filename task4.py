'''Task 4 just infill with hard coded file'''

'''pseudo-code for gap-filling but would be in lvisTiff

define function named fill_gaps where arg is the raster file path
    read the raster (rasterio?) - https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.fill.html 
    identify gaps - NaN values
    fill gaps with interpolation (nearest neighbour)
    write the modified raster to file

    then call this function in the main block to process the raster
    save with an updated file name (e.g. filled_DEM)

    with attempt below that runs but doens't change anything
    -need to double check how the data gaps are recorded - as 0's?
